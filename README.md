My name is Mackenzie Ash and I am currently a junior at Brigham Young University Idaho. I'm majoring in Computer Science for a Bachelor in Science as well as minoring in Fine Arts.

I have basic skills in Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, C#, and Erlang. 
I have designed a couple of websites in school projects and made several coding projects for Python, C#, and Erlang including a couple of games.
